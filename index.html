		<h1>wkhtmltopdf-reset</h1>
		<p>A css file and a javascript file that you can use to ease the printing process</p>
		<h2>How to use</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the jquery and wkhtmltopdf.js scripts</li>
			<li>Add the wkhtmltopdf.css stylesheet</li>
			<li>Set the class on the body to something like <strong>class=&quot;a4 landscape&quot;</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What do you get?</h2>
		<p>Some helpers</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>class="wk-page"</strong> a segment that will fill one page (like this page)</li>
			<li><strong>class="wk-table"</strong> a table that (using js) breaks up per-page, a copy of &lt;tr class=&quot;header&quot;&gt; is repeated on each page</li>
			<li><strong>class="wk-html"</strong> a segment denoting general HTMLness</li>
			<li><strong>class="wk-hiddentitle"</strong> applied to h1, h2, h3 will be hidden from view, but still count toward the TOC and headers / footers pages</li>
			<li>You can also load data by passing a cookie (like this page)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Nota Bene</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You <em>must</em> use the <em>--disable-smart-shrinking</em> flag to make this work</li>
			<li>Tested with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list">11.0 static binary</a></li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<pre>./wkhtmltopdf-i386 --page-size A4 --orientation landscape <span style="color: #00FF00;">--disable-smart-shrinking</span> --dpi 150 --header-html header.html --footer-html footer.html index.html index.html.pdf</pre>
		<p>You can load data like so</p>
		<pre>./wkhtmltopdf-i386 --page-size A4 --orientation landscape --disable-smart-shrinking <span style="color: #00FF00;">--cookie datafile './data.js'</span> --dpi 150 --header-html header.html --footer-html footer.html index.html index.html.pdf</pre>
		<p>Then, in your javascript use: <strong>wk.loaddatafile(success, error);</strong> where success and error are regular jQuery functions</p>
	</div>

		<h2>oh, hello table</h2>
		<h2>Is she dead, yes or no?</h2>
		<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
		<h2>Hold on to your butts</h2>
		<p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
		<h2>No man, I don't eat pork</h2>
		<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

		<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>
		<p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

		<h2>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h2>
		<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

		<h2>I'm serious as a heart attack</h2>
		<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>
